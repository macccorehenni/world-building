While _Fey-blooded_ often is used to describe all who can wield Fey magics, it strictly refers to those who can wield [[Fey magic]], but not those who can purify the [[Feybraid]] (that is, the [[Fey-touched]]). While anyone in the Multi-world could be Fey-blooded only those who have been exposed to an area where the Feyveil is strong will know if this is the case. Alternatively, there are lab tests that one can receive that will seek the specific chemical compounds in ones’ blood that signify that they are Fey-blooded.
